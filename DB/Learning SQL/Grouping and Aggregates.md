Aggregate Functions
`MAX(),MIN(),AVG(),SUM(),COUNT()`

### Counting Distinct Values
When using the `count()` function, you have your choice of counting all members in the group on only the distinct values for a column across all members of the group
	`SELECT COUNT(customer_id) num_rows COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) num_customers FROM ...;`


### How Nulls are handled
Aggregation functions ignore any null values encountered.

### Multicolumn grouping
if you want  to generate groups that span more than one column:
	`GROUP BY first_column, second_column..`

### Grouping via Expressions
Along with using columns to group data, you can build groups based on the values generated by expressions.
	`SELECT extract(YEAR FROM rental_date) year ..... GROUP BY year;`

### Generating Rollups
	`GROUP BY ..,.. WITH ROLLUP`

### Group Filter Conditions
When grouping data, the `HAVING` clause is where you should place filter conditions to the data after the groups have been generated.
NOTE: the filters in the `WHERE` clause are evaluated before grouping occurs.
