### Outer Join
`LEFT OUTER JOIN`:
 to include all rows from the table on the left side   of the join, and then include columns from the   table on the right side of the join.

### Cross Joins 
...useless
### Natural Joins
this  join type relies on identical column names across multiple tables to infer the proper join conditions.
YOU SHOULD AVOID THIS JOIN!!!.
