## ONE QUANTITATIVE VARIABLE: SHAPE AND CENTER
In describing a single quantitative variable, we generally consider the following three questions:
• What is the general shape of the data?
• Where are the data values centered?
• How do the data vary?
These are all aspects of what we call the distribution of the data.
### Symmetric and Skewed Distributions
We are often interested in the general “big picture” shape of a distribution. A
distribution is considered symmetric if we can fold the plot (either a histogram or
dotplot) over a vertical center line and the two sides match closely. When we con-
sider the shape of a dataset, we ask: Is it approximately symmetric? If not, is the data
piled up on one side? If so, which side? Are there outliers? These are all questions
that a histogram or dotplot can help us answer.

## The Center of a Distribution
### Mean: 
The mean for a single quantitative variable is the numerical average of the data
values:
$$ Mean = Σx / n $$
### Median:
The median of a set of data values for a single quantitative variable, denoted m, is
- the middle entry if an ordered list of the data values contains an odd
number of entries, or
- the average of the middle two values if an ordered list contains an
even number of entries.
The median splits the data in half.


## ONE QUANTITATIVE VARIABLE: MEASURES OF SPREAD
### Definition of Standard Deviation
The standard deviation for a quantitative variable measures the
spread of the data in a sample:
The standard deviation gives a rough estimate of the typical distance
of a data value from the mean. The larger the standard deviation,
the more variability there is in the data and the more spread out the
data are.

### Five Number Summary
Five Number Summary = (minimum, Q 1 , median, Q 3 , maximum)
where
	Q 1 = First quartile = 25th percentile
	Q 3 = Third quartile = 75th percentile
The five number summary divides the dataset into fourths: about 25%
of the data fall between any two consecutive numbers in the five num-
ber summary.

### Range and Interquartile Range
From the five number summary, we can compute the following two
statistics:
	Range = Maximum − Minimum
	Interquartile range (IQR) = Q 3 − Q 1


### TWO QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES: SCATTERPLOT AND CORRELATION

### Scatterplot:
A scatterplot is a graph of the relationship between two quantitative
variables.
A scatterplot includes a pair of axes with appropriate numerical scales,
one for each variable. The paired data for each case are plotted as a
point on the scatterplot. If there are explanatory and response variables, we put the explanatory variable on the horizontal axis and the
response variable on the vertical axis.
