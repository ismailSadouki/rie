# 1.5 Estimation and Elimination of Trend and Seasonal Components
**the classical decomposition model**
$$
X_t=m_t+s_t+y_t
$$
If the seasonal and noise fluctuations appear to increase with the level of the process, then a preliminary transformation of the data is often used to make the transformed data more compatible with this model.

In this section we shall assume that this model is appropriate (possibly after a preliminary transformation of the data) and examine some techniques for estimating the components mt , st ,and Yt in the model.

Our aim is to estimate and extract the deterministic components mt and st in the
hope that the residual or noise component Yt will turn out to be a stationary time series.
