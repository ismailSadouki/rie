### Prediction intervals
The first prediction interval is easy to calculate. If ^σ is the standard deviation of the residuals, then a 95% prediction interval is given by ^yT+1|T±1.96^σ. This result is true for all ARIMA models regardless of their parameters and orders.

In Section [9.4](https://otexts.com/fpp3/MA.html#MA), we showed that an AR(1) model can be written as an MA(∞) model. Using this equivalence, the above result for MA(q) models can also be used to obtain prediction intervals for AR(1) models.

<mark>The prediction intervals for ARIMA models are based on assumptions that the residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed. If either of these assumptions does not hold, then the prediction intervals may be incorrect. For this reason, always plot the ACF and histogram of the residuals to check the assumptions before producing prediction intervals.</mark>

If the residuals are uncorrelated but not normally distributed, then bootstrapped intervals can be obtained instead, as discussed in Section [5.5](https://otexts.com/fpp3/prediction-intervals.html#prediction-intervals). This is easily achieved by simply adding `bootstrap=TRUE` in the `forecast()` function.

In general, prediction intervals from ARIMA models increase as the forecast horizon increases. For stationary models (i.e., with d=0) they will converge, so that prediction intervals for long horizons are all essentially the same. For d≥1, the prediction intervals will continue to grow into the future.

As with most prediction interval calculations, ARIMA-based intervals tend to be too narrow. This occurs because only the variation in the errors has been accounted for. There is also variation in the parameter estimates, and in the model order, that has not been included in the calculation. In addition, the calculation assumes that the historical patterns that have been modelled will continue into the forecast period.
