### Example: Egyptian exports
The following R code selects a non-seasonal ARIMA model automatically.
```
fit <- global_economy |>
  filter(Code == "EGY") |>
  model(ARIMA(Exports))
report(fit)
#> Series: Exports 
#> Model: ARIMA(2,0,1) w/ mean 
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#>          ar1      ar2      ma1  constant
#>       1.6764  -0.8034  -0.6896    2.5623
#> s.e.  0.1111   0.0928   0.1492    0.1161
#> 
#> sigma^2 estimated as 8.046:  log likelihood=-141.6
#> AIC=293.1   AICc=294.3   BIC=303.4
```

  autoplot(global_economy) +
  labs(y = "% of GDP", title = "Egyptian exports")
```

The value of p is important if the data show cycles. To obtain cyclic forecasts, it is necessary to have p≥2, along with some additional conditions on the parameters. For an AR(2) model, cyclic behaviour occurs if $ϕ^2_1+4ϕ_2<0$ (as is the case for the Egyptian exports model). In that case, the average period of the cycles is[19](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fn19)

Figures [9.9](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fig:egyptacf) and [9.10](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fig:egyptpacf) shows the ACF and PACF plots for the Egyptian exports data shown in Figure [9.7](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fig:egyptexports). The partial autocorrelations have the same critical values of ±1.96/√T as for ordinary autocorrelations, and these are typically shown on the plot as in Figure [9.10](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fig:egyptpacf).

In Figure [9.9](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fig:egyptacf), we see that there is a decaying sinusoidal pattern in the ACF, and in Figure [9.10](https://otexts.com/fpp3/non-seasonal-arima.html#fig:egyptpacf) the PACF shows the last significant spike at lag 4. This is what you would expect from an ARIMA(4,0,0) model.
```
fit2 <- global_economy |>
  filter(Code == "EGY") |>
  model(ARIMA(Exports ~ pdq(4,0,0)))
report(fit2)
#> Series: Exports 
#> Model: ARIMA(4,0,0) w/ mean 
#> 
#> Coefficients:
#>          ar1      ar2     ar3      ar4  constant
#>       0.9861  -0.1715  0.1807  -0.3283    6.6922
#> s.e.  0.1247   0.1865  0.1865   0.1273    0.3562
#> 
#> sigma^2 estimated as 7.885:  log likelihood=-140.5
#> AIC=293.1   AICc=294.7   BIC=305.4
```
This model is only slightly worse than the ARIMA(2,0,1) model identified by `ARIMA()` (with an AICc value of 294.70 compared to 294.29).
We can also specify particular values of `pdq()` that `ARIMA()` can search for. For example, to find the best ARIMA model with p∈{1,2,3}, q∈{0,1,2} and d=1, you could use `ARIMA(y ~ pdq(p=1:3, d=1, q=0:2))`.
