- Short-term forecasts
	are needed for the scheduling of personnel, production and transportation. As part of the scheduling process, forecasts of demand are often also required.

- Medium-term forecasts
	are needed to determine future resource requirements, in order to purchase raw materials, hire personnel, or buy machinery and equipment.

- Long-term forecasts
	are used in strategic planning. Such decisions must take account of market opportunities, environmental factors and internal resources.
## 1.4 Forecasting data and methods
If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then **qualitative forecasting** methods must be used.

**Quantitative forecasting** can be applied when two conditions are satisfied:
- numerical information about the past is available;
- it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future.
## 1.6 The basic steps in a forecasting task
#### Step 1: Problem definition.
#### Step 2: Gathering information.
#### Step 3: Preliminary (exploratory) analysis.
Are there consistent patterns? Is there a significant trend? Is seasonality important? Is there evidence of the presence of business cycles? Are there any outliers in the data that need to be explained by those with expert knowledge? How strong are the relationships among the variables available for analysis?
#### Step 4: Choosing and fitting models.
#### Step 5: Using and evaluating a forecasting model.


## 1.7 The statistical forecasting perspective

When we obtain a forecast, we are estimating the _middle_ of the range of possible values the random variable could take.

Often, a forecast is accompanied by a **prediction interval** giving a _range_ of values the random variable could take with relatively high probability.
we usually show these prediction intervals. Figure [1.3](https://otexts.com/fpp3/perspective.html#fig:austa2) shows 80% and 95% intervals for the future Australian international visitors. The blue line is the average of the possible future values, which we call the **point forecasts**.

When we talk about the “forecast”, we usually mean the average value of the forecast distribution, and we put a “hat” over y to show this. Thus, we write the forecast of yt as ^yt, meaning the average of the possible values that yt could take given everything we know.
