### Example 3.3 Explosive AR Models and Causality
it was discovered that the random walk xt = xt−1 + wt is not stationary. We might wonder whether there is a stationary AR(1) process with |φ| > 1. Such processes are called explosive because the values of the time series quickly become large in magnitude Clearly, because |φ| j increases without bound  as j → ∞,
however, modify that argument to obtain a stationary model as follows. Write $x_{t+1} = φx_t + w_{t+1}$ , in which case,
![](https://i.imgur.com/PNHNoG0.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/6wGLcXJ.png)
this is stationary and of the AR(1) form $x_t = φx_{t−1} + w_t$
Unfortunately, this model is useless because it requires us to know the future to be able to predict the future.
When a process does not depend on the future, such as
the AR(1) when |φ| < 1, we will say the process is <mark>causal</mark>. In the explosive case of this example, the process is stationary, but it is also future dependent, and not
causal

### Example 3.4 Every Explosion Has a Cause
Excluding explosive models from consideration is not a problem because the models have causal counterparts. For example, if
$$x_t = φx_{t−1} + w_t$$

with |φ| > 1 and wt ∼ iid $N(0, σ_w^2 )$,
then using (3.11), {xt } is a non-causal stationary Gaussian
process with E(xt ) = 0 and
![](https://i.imgur.com/WMaQkSG.png)
Thus, using (3.7), the causal process deﬁned by
$$yt = φ^{−1} y_{t−1} + v_t$$
where vt ∼ iid N(0, σw2 φ−2 ) is stochastically equal to the xt process
(i.e., all ﬁnite distributions of the processes are the same).
For example, if xt = 2xt−1 + wt with σw2 = 1, then yt = (1/2) yt−1 + vt with σv2 = 1/4 is an equivalent causal process

![](https://i.imgur.com/J4cibYd.png)

the AR(1) process: $$ x_t = \phi{x_{t-1}} +w_t$$
Iterating backwards k times we get
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZUbNrRJ.png)
and by continuing to iterate backward and provided that $|\phi|<1$ and the var($x_t$) is finite we can represent an AR(1) as a <mark>Linear process</mark>
$$x_t=\sum_{j=0}^\infty{\phi^jw_{t-j}}$$0
this called <mark>the stationary solution of the model</mark> (Linear model form)
<mark>Note again this is true if and only if:</mark>  $|\phi|<1$ 

In operator form:
$$(1-\phi B)x_t=w_t$$
$$ x_t=(1-\phi B)^{-1}w_t$$
and
$$(1-\phi B)^{-1}= 1+\phi B +\phi^2B^2+...+\phi^jB^j+....$$
again this is convergent (or in our case stationnaire)  if and only if ($|\phi|<1$)

---
in our problem $$x_t = \alpha x_{t-1} + w_t$$
such that $|\alpha| >1$
Hence to make the series stationnaire we should let: 
$$-1 < \phi = 1/\alpha < 1$$
based on the previews explanation

# Introduction to Moving Average Models

![](https://i.imgur.com/kNpVczQ.png)
the moving average process is stationary for any values of the parameters θ 1, . . . , θ q ;\
#### Example 3.5
![](https://i.imgur.com/TR5zC9C.png)
Note | ρ(1)| ≤ 1/2 for all values of θ
xt is correlated with xt−1 , but not with xt−2, xt−3, . . .
### Example 3.6 Non-uniqueness of MA Models and Invertibility
Using Example 3.5, we note that for an MA(1) model, ρ(h) is the same for θ and 1/θ

To aid in the investigation of ARMA models, it will be useful to
write them using the AR operator, (3.5), and the MA operator, (3.18). In particular,
the ARMA(p, q) model in (3.19) can then be written in concise form as
![](https://i.imgur.com/H6mfQS8.png)
The concise form of the model points to a potential problem in that we can unnecessarily complicate the model by multiplying both sides by another operator, say

#### Example 3.7 Parameter Redundancy
![](https://i.imgur.com/frkf33H.png)


Example 3.3, Example 3.6, and Example 3.7 point to a number of problems with
the general deﬁnition of ARMA(p, q) models, as given by (3.19), or, equivalently,
by (3.21). To summarize, we have seen the following problems:
(i) parameter redundant models,
(ii) stationary AR models that depend on the future, and
(iii) MA models that are not unique.
To overcome these problems, we will require some additional restrictions on the
model parameters. First, we make the following deﬁnitions.
![](https://i.imgur.com/5ZOm7Qq.png)
To address the ﬁrst problem, we will henceforth refer to an ARMA(p, q) model to
mean that it is in its simplest form. That is, in addition to the original deﬁnition given in equation (3.19), we will also require that φ(z) and θ(z) have no common factors. So, the process, xt = .5xt−1 − .5wt−1 + wt , discussed in Example 3.7 is not referred to as an ARMA(1, 1) process because, in its reduced form, xt is white noise.

To address the problem of future-dependent models, we formally introduce the
concept of causality.
![](https://i.imgur.com/W2xsqia.png)
In Example 3.3, the AR(1) process, xt = φxt−1 + wt , is causal only when |φ| < 1.
![](https://i.imgur.com/u0BvLUh.png)
Another way to phrase Property 3.1 is that an ARMA process is causal only when
the roots of φ(z) lie outside the unit circle; that is, φ(z) = 0 only when |z| > 1
Finally,to address the problem of uniqueness discussed in Example 3.6, we choose the model that allows an inﬁnite autoregressive representation.
![](https://i.imgur.com/QIYoaoC.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/pnGZSFW.png)
Another way to phrase Property 3.2 is that an ARMA process is invertible only
when the roots of θ(z) lie outside the unit circle; that is, θ(z) = 0 only when |z| > 1.

### Example 3.8 Parameter Redundancy, Causality, Invertibility
![](https://i.imgur.com/r17Ylmd.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/qBHHGFA.png)
The model is causal because φ(z) = (1 − .9z) = 0 when z = 10/9, which is
outside the unit circle. The model is also invertible because the root of θ(z) =
(1 + .5z) is z = −2, which is outside the unit circle.
