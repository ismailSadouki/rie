## 6.2 Strictly stationary series
A time series model $\{x_t\}$ is strictly stationary if the joint statistical distribution of $x_{t_1} , . . . , x_{t_n}$ is the same as the joint distribution of $x_{t_1 +m} , . . . , x_{t_n +m}$ for all $t_1 , . . . , t_n$ and $m$, so that the distribution is unchanged after an arbitrary time shift.
Note that strict stationarity implies that the mean and variance
are constant in time and that the autocovariance $Cov(x_t , x_s )$ only depends on $lag\, k = |t − s|$ and can be written $γ(k)$.
If a series is not strictly stationary but the mean and variance are constant in time and the autocovariance only depends on the lag, then the series is called **second-order stationary**.

we assume our data are a realisation of a stationary process. So our first step in an analysis should be to check whether there is any evidence of a trend or seasonal effects and, if there is, remove them.

Regression can break down a non-stationary series to a trend, seasonal components, and residual series. It is often reasonable to treat the time series of residuals as a realisation of a stationary error series. Therefore, the models in this chapter are often fitted to residual series arising from regression analyses.

In general, an MA(q) process is invertible when the roots of $φ_q (B)$ all
exceed unity in absolute value (Exercise 2). The autocovariance function only
identifies a unique MA(q) process if the condition that the process be invertible
is imposed.The estimation procedure described in §6.4 leads naturally to
invertible models

## 6.4.1 Model fitted to simulated series
MA models cannot be expressed in a multiple regression form, and, in general, the parameters are estimated with a numerical algorithm.
