### 2.2.2 The ensemble and stationarity
**NOTE:** If the mean function is constant, we say that the time series model is
stationary in the mean.
#### 2.2.3 Ergodic series*
A time series model that is stationary in the mean is ergodic in the mean if
the time average for a single time series tends to the ensemble mean as the
length of the time series increases:
$$
lim_{(n->inf)} \frac{\sum{x_t}}{n} = \mu
$$
This implies that the time average is independent of the starting point.

### 2.2.4 Variance function
If we assume the model is stationary in the variance, the constant population variance, $σ^2$ , can be estimated from the sample variance:
$$
Var(x) = \frac{\sum{(x_t-\bar{x})^2}}{n-1}
$$
In a time series analysis, sequential observations may be correlated. If the cor-
relation is positive, Var(x) will tend to underestimate the population variance
in a short series because successive observations tend to be relatively similar.
In most cases, this does not present a problem since the bias decreases rapidly
as the length n of the series increases

### 2.2.5 Autocorrelation

If a time series model is second-order stationary, we can define an **autocovariance** function (acvf ), $γ_k$  as a function of the lag $k$:
$$
γ_k = E [(x_t − µ)(x_{t+k} − µ)]
$$
The function γk does not depend on t because the expectation, which is across
the ensemble, is the same at all times t.
The lag $k$ **autocorrelation** function (acf ), $ρ_k$ , is defined by
$$
ρ_k = \frac{γ_k}{\sigma^2}
$$

### 2.3 The correlogram
By default, the acf function produces a plot of $r_k$ against k, which is called
the correlogram.

- If you construct a time series that consists of a trend only, the integers from
1 up to 1000 for example, the acf decreases slowly and almost linearly from
1.
- If you take a large number of cycles of a discrete sinusoidal wave of any
amplitude and phase, the acf is a discrete cosine function of the same
period
- If you construct a time series that consists of an arbitrary sequence of p
numbers repeated many times, the correlogram has a dominant spike of
almost 1 at lag p

The main use  of the correlogram is to detect autocorrelations in the time series after we have removed an estimate of the trend and seasonal variation. 

## 2.4 Covariance of sums of random variables

Let x1 , x2 , . . . , xn and y1 , y2 , . . . , ym be random variables. Then

where Cov(x, y) is the covariance between a pair of random variables x and
y. The result tells us that the covariance of two sums of variables is the sum of all possible covariance pairs of the variables. Note that the special case of
n = m and xi = yi (i = 1, . . . , n) occurs in subsequent chapters for a time
series {xt }.

# 3. Forecasting Strategies

## 3.2 Leading variables and associated variables
### Cross-correlation
Suppose we have time series models for variables x and y that are stationary
in the mean and the variance. The variables may each be serially correlated, and correlated with each other at different time lags.The combined model is
second-order stationary if all these correlations depend only on the lag, and
then we can define the cross covariance function (ccvf ), $γ_k (x, y)$, as a function
of the lag, k:
$$
γ_k (x, y) = E [(x_{t+k} − µ_x )(y_t − µ_y )]
$$
- If k>0, we compare future values of x with present values of y i.e., does x lead y?).
- If k<0, we compare past values of x with present values of y (i.e., does y lead x?).

- **Trend & Seasonality**: If both time series have **trends or seasonal effects**, these will dominate the CCF. The **CCF is defined for stationary processes**, so it is standard practice to **remove trends and seasonal effects** before analysis.

### 3.4.1 Exponential Smoothing Explained
Exponential smoothing is a forecasting technique used when predicting a future value $x_{n+k}$​ based on past observations ${x_1,x_2,…,x_n}$. It is particularly useful when:

- **There is no systematic trend or seasonal effects**, or they have been **removed**.
- The **mean of the process can change** over time, but there is no clear **predictable direction** for these changes.
- The goal is to **make short-term forecasts** for a stable system, such as predicting sales of a **well-established product**.
A typical application is forecasting sales of a well-established
product in a stable market. The model is
$$
x_t=\mu_t+w_t
$$
where µt is the non-stationary mean of the process at time t and wt are
independent random deviations (White Noise) with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation σ.

Given that there is no systematic trend, an intuitively reasonable estimate of the mean at time t is given by a weighted average of our observation at time t and our
estimate of the mean at time t − 1:$$ a_t = αx_t + (1 − α)a_{t−1}$$
The at in Equation is the exponentially weighted moving average
(EWMA) at time t. The value of α determines the amount of smoothing,
and it is referred to as the smoothing parameter. If α is near 1, there is little
smoothing and at is approximately xt .
### **Role of the Smoothing Parameter (α\alphaα)**

- **α close to 1** → Less smoothing, responds quickly to changes.
    - Suitable when the mean changes rapidly.
- **α close to 0** → More smoothing, slow response to changes.
    - Suitable when the mean changes gradually.
- **Typical choice**: α=0.2 (balances responsiveness and smoothness).
- **Optimized α**: R and other statistical tools can estimate the best value.
Since we have assumed that there is no systematic trend and that there are no seasonal effects, forecasts made at time n for any lead time are just the estimated mean at time n. The forecasting  equation is
$$
\hat{x}_{x+k|n} = a_n
$$
