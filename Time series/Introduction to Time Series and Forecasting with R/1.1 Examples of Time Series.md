NOTE:
Smoothness of the graph of a time series is generally indicative of the existence of some form of dependence among the observations.

#### 1.3.3 A General Approach to Time Series Modeling
1. Plot the series and check for:
	(a) a trend,
	(b) a seasonal component,
	(c) any apparent sharp changes in behavior,
	(d) any outlying observations.
2. Remove the trend and seasonal components to get stationary residuals
3. Choose a model to fit the residuals
4. Forecasting will be achieved by forecasting the residuals and then inverting the transformations described above to arrive at forecasts of the original series {Xt }.
5. An extremely useful alternative approach is to express the series in terms of its Fourier components.

#### 1.5.3 Estimating trends and seasonal effects
#### Moving averate:
A **moving average (MA)** is a smoothing technique used to remove short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends in time series data. It calculates the average of a specified number of values **around each point** in the series, except for the first and last few values, where there might not be enough data points to compute a full average.
