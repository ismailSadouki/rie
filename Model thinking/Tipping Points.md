A **tipping point** is the **critical threshold** at which a small change causes a **dramatic shift** in the state or behavior of a system. It comes from complex systems theory and is widely used in science, sociology, economics, data science, and climate studies.
# Percolation Models
**Percolation models** are mathematical models used to study how **connectedness** or **spread** emerges in a system made of many individual parts. They are widely used in physics, network theory, epidemiology, social science, and data science to analyze **critical thresholds** and **tipping points** in complex systems.
## ðŸ§  Core Idea:

> **Percolation** studies how things (like liquid, fire, information, or disease) flow through a **random medium or network**.

## ðŸ“Š Types of Percolation

| Type                      | Description                                                    |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Site percolation**      | Nodes are randomly occupied (e.g., cells in a grid).           |
| **Bond percolation**      | Edges (connections) are randomly occupied.                     |
| **Directed percolation**  | Spread happens in a preferred direction (e.g., time, gravity). |
| **Continuum percolation** | Objects like disks or spheres are randomly placed in space.    |

### **Information percolation** 
**Information percolation** refers to the process by which **information spreads through a network**, often modeled using **percolation theory**. Itâ€™s a concept that bridges **network science**, **economics**, **data science**, and **social dynamics**, helping us understand **how information flows, accumulates, or gets blocked** in systems of interacting agents.
## ðŸ§  Core Idea

> Think of each person (or node) as a container of knowledge, and each connection as a channel. **Information percolates** when it can spread from one node to many others through those connections.





# **Contagion models of diffusion**
**Contagion models of diffusion** describe how **ideas, behaviors, products, diseases, or emotions** spread through populations or networks. These models are central in **epidemiology**, **sociology**, **marketing**, **data science**, and **network theory**.
## ðŸ§  Core Concept

> Contagion = something (a disease, behavior, info, etc.) is **transmitted from one agent to another** through contact or influence.

- **Diffusion** = the **spread** over time and space.
    
- Contagion models show **how and when** this spread **accelerates, saturates, or dies out**.

## **SIS model**
The **SIS model** (Susceptibleâ€“Infectedâ€“Susceptible) is a classical **contagion model** used in epidemiology and network theory to simulate **recurrent infections**â€”where individuals **can be reinfected after recovery**.
