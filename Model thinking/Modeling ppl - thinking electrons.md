# Rational Actors
The **Rational Actor Model (RAM)** is a framework used to understand and predict how individuals or organizations make decisions, assuming they act in a **logical, consistent, and utility-maximizing** way.
A rational actor is one who **consistently makes decisions** that maximize their **utility (benefit, profit, satisfaction)** based on available information and preferences.
## üß± Key Assumptions

1. **Goal-Oriented**: The actor has a **clear objective** or utility function to maximize.
    
2. **Consistent Preferences**: Choices are based on **stable, transitive preferences** (if A > B and B > C, then A > C).
    
3. **Full Information**: The actor knows all relevant options and outcomes.
    
4. **Optimal Decision-Making**: The actor chooses the **best available option** based on cost-benefit analysis.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **Bounded Rationality**: Humans have cognitive limits and time constraints (Herbert Simon).
    
2. **Irrational Behavior**: People often act on emotion, habit, or bias (see behavioral economics).
    
3. **Incomplete Information**: Often, decisions are made under uncertainty or limited data.
    
4. **Multiple Actors**: Organizations may not act as a single rational entity due to internal conflict.

### Decision Vs Game
Decision: Objectives depend only on own action.
Game: Objective depends on actions of others.

# Behavioral Models
A **behavioral model** is a framework for understanding how **real people actually make decisions**, especially when they deviate from what the **rational actor model** would predict.
These models come from **behavioral economics, psychology, and cognitive science**, and they are essential in **data science**, **AI**, **policy**, **marketing**, and **human-computer interaction** ‚Äî anywhere human decision-making is modeled or influenced.
## üß† What is a Behavioral Model?

A **behavioral model** describes decision-making based on:

- **Cognitive biases**
    
- **Emotions**
    
- **Social influences**
    
- **Mental shortcuts (heuristics)**
    
- **Imperfect information**
    

> üîç **In short**: It accepts that **humans are not always rational**, and models them **as they are**, not as they "should" be.

## üéØ Behavioral Models in Action

### 1. **Prospect Theory** (Kahneman & Tversky)

- Describes how people actually perceive gains and losses.
    
- People are **risk-averse in gains**, **risk-seeking in losses**.
    
- Replaces the rational model‚Äôs utility with **psychological value functions**.
### 2. **Theory of Planned Behavior**

- Models human behavior as shaped by **intentions**, which are influenced by:
    
    - **Attitudes** toward the behavior
        
    - **Subjective norms**
        
    - **Perceived behavioral control**
- ### 3. **Bounded Rationality** (Herbert Simon)

- Humans try to make rational decisions but are limited by:
    
    - Time
        
    - Information
        
    - Cognitive capacity
        
- Leads to **satisficing**: choosing an option that‚Äôs ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù


# Rule based models
## Mimicry
**Mimicry** is the act of **imitating or copying** the behavior, appearance, or strategies of another entity. The term is used in various domains, each with its own context and meaning: Mimicry may appear when:
- A model **copies user behavior** (e.g., recommendation systems).
    
- **Synthetic data** mimics the distribution of real data.
