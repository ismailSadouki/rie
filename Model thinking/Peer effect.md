sometimes the ppl at the of the distirbution are the ppl who derives what happens the result is that it could be hard to predict what well happen

## **Granovetterâ€™s Model**

Each person has a **threshold**: the number (or proportion) of others who must act before they will act.
### **How It Works (Mechanics):**

- Imagine a crowd of people, each with a **threshold** from 0 to 100%.
    
- The **threshold** represents: "What percent of people around me need to be protesting before I join?"

collective acction  is more likely to happen if:
- Lower thresholds
- more variation in thresholds
