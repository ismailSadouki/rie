## Six Sigma
In statistics, **"sigma" (Ïƒ)** represents the **standard deviation** â€” a measure of variability or spread in a data set.

- **6 sigma** means that the process mean is **six standard deviations away from the nearest specification limit** (upper or lower).
    
- In a **normal distribution**, this results in **very few defects** â€” about **3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO)**.

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Six Sigma as a Quality Management Methodology:**
It's a **set of techniques and tools for process improvement**, aiming to reduce variation and defects.
Uses **DMAIC** framework:

- **Define**
    
- **Measure**
    
- **Analyze**
    
- **Improve**
    
- **Control**

### ðŸ§  Intuition:

Imagine you're manufacturing bolts:

- If your production is at "6 sigma" quality, then **99.99966%** of the bolts meet specifications.
    
- That means only **3-4 bad bolts per million** â€” nearly perfect!


# Game of life
#### ðŸŽ² **Conway's Game of Life**

### ðŸ§  What it is:

- A **zero-player game**: after the initial setup, no input is needed â€” it runs by itself.
    
- It simulates how **patterns evolve over time** based on **simple rules**.
    
- Used to explore **emergence, complexity, and self-organization** in systems.
######  **Modeling Complex Systems with Simple Rules**
- **Simple local rules** (cell + neighbors) can produce **complex global patterns**
    
- This mirrors ideas in **agent-based modeling**, **network science**, and **cellular automata** used in:
	-  Epidemiology (e.g., COVID spread)
	    
	- Urban modeling
	    
	- Ecosystem simulation
