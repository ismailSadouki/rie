### isinstance()
return true, if the first argument is an instance of that class. Multiple classes can also be checked at once.
## help()
you could use help() function or "?","??" in front of the function to get help about specific function.

### Control Flow (short hand if)
	print("A") if a>b else print("=") if a == b else print("B") 


## Module
In Python a module is simply a file with the .py extension containing Python code.

## Object reference check
To check if two references refer to the same object, use the is keyword.
	> a is b
## Mutable and immutable objects
Most objects in Python, such as lists, dicts, NumPy arrays, and most user-defined
types (classes), are mutable. This means that the object or values that they contain can
be modified.
Others, like strings and tuples, are immutable:

## The floor division operator "//"
drops the fractional part if the result is not a whole number

## Multi-line strings
for multi-line strings with break line use triple quotes.
	> c = ' ' ' 
	> 	  This is the longer string that
	> 	   spans multiple lines
	> 	' ' '

## None
None is the Python null value type. If a function does not explicitly return a value, it
implicitly returns None.

## Ternary expressions
A ternary expression in Python allows you to combine an if-else block that pro‚Äê
duces a value into a single line or expression.
	value = true-expr if condition else false-expr
