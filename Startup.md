## 🧠 **2. DeepNerve: Adaptive Route Intelligence Based on Fear Theory**

### ✅ How It Works:

1. **Core Hypothesis**: Humans under threat don’t pick optimal paths — they pick the **least scary** ones.
    
    - They hide, avoid open terrain, and move erratically.
        
    - This is **very different** from shortest path algorithms.
        
2. **Data Inputs**:
    
    - Satellite imagery (terrain, roads, cover like forests).
        
    - GIS layers for elevation, rivers, urban zones.
        
    - OpenWeather API (wind, moonlight, temperature).
        
    - Optional: Interviews or simulation data of refugee or smuggler behavior.
        
3. **Model Design**:
    
    - Build a **"fear heatmap"** model based on:
        
        - Distance to cover
            
        - Visibility (e.g. open field vs forest)
            
        - Time of day
            
        - Potential patrol zones
            
    - Combine reinforcement learning with behavioral psychology to model decision-making under stress.
        
4. **Simulation**:
    
    - Run **pathfinding simulations** of thousands of agents with different fear sensitivities.
        
    - Compare with real-world data or known historical crossing routes.
