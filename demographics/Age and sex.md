## Dependency ratios
Dependency ratios provide simple summary measures of age composition, with
particular reference to relati ve numbers of supposed ' dependants' and 'support-
ers', or ' unproductive' and 'productive' groups. The ratios are based on a division
of the age range into three broad groupings, namely: children (0-14 years), 'work-
ing ages' (15-64 years), a nd 'old' ages (65 years and over). Varying these ranges,
such as through ra ising or lowering the upper limit of the working ages, can affect
the ratios apprecia bly.
