# 4.2 Direct standardization
T here are two approaches to standardization: ' direct' and ' indirect' .
Direct standardization employs a 'standard' age structure (or other aspect of popula tion composition), while indirect standardization employs a standard set of age-specific rates - calculated for each age group:

To calculate a sta ndardized crude rate, the steps are:
1. Select a standard population, whose age distribution will be the sta ndard for
comparison. The standard population is normally the population of foremost
interest in an investiga tion.

In su mmary, direct sta ndardization by age invo lves applying di fferent age-specific rates to a standard age distribution according to the formula

#### Interpreting standardized rates
The main benefit of direct standardization is that it facilitates comparisons by re-
moving the confounding effects on rates of age structure variations, or other dif-
ferences in population composition.
In interpreting and presenting findings, another question arising concerns
whether the standardized rates should be used instead of the original crude rates.
Standardized rates provide comparisons, but do not substitute for the original
rates.They are constructs that indicate the effects of compositional influences.
They va ry according to the standard adopted.
As artificial indices to aid comparisons,
standardized rates are often presented in conjunction with the unstandardized
rates. Also, standardization by age does not remove all confounding influences, al
though age is usually the most important compositional influence on mortality

## Standardizing by more than one variable
Sometimes it is desirable to standardize by more than one variable, such as age and sex. The aim might be to allow for the effect on the CDR of differences in both age composition and the representation of the sexes. Rates standardized by more tha n one variable are calculated by determining expected deaths separately for each variable and adding them together to obtain total expected deaths. The rates must be specific to each of the variables considered. Just as standardizing by age means using a standard age distribution, standardizing by age and sex means using a standard age-sex distribution.


# 4 .4 Period and cohort analyses

The general definition of a cohort is a group of people who experienced the same
demographic event, such as birth, marriage, or migration, during the same period
of time, usually a single year or a five year interval
A concise definition of a cohort is: a group with the same 'event origin '. The event
origin identifying each type of cohort is the date or year of birth, marriage or
migration.

## The Lexis diagram
The Lexis diagram is a square grid depicting the location of demographic events in time.
![](https://i.imgur.com/zGZ1KlN.png)
On the Lexis diagram, the horizontal axis depicts calendar time through a series
of points and fixed intervals. The points represent dates, such as 1st January, while the intervals are calendar years. The vertical axis represents duration, commonly age or duration of life. Points on the vertical axis are anniversaries of the identifying event, such as birthdays. The scales on the horizontal and vertical axes are the same, producing the squa re grid.
Diagonal lines across the grid represent the lives of individuals.
For example, a child born 1 January 2000 will be 1 year old 1/1/2001, two years old 1/1/2002

The Lexis diagram assists in visualizing the differences between period analysis
and cohort a nalysis. Period analysis entails working with data for a vertical cross-
section on the diagram of Lexis. The cross-section consists of information for all
age groups, or at least a selection of age groups, at the same date or year. The vertical lines on the diagram represent cross-sections at dates, while the shaded vertical band is a cross-section for the calendar year 2000. In contrast, cohort analysis uses data for one group - such as the year 2000 birth cohort, as depicted by the diagonal band. Clearly cohort analysis requires data on the same people over successive years and ages. The difficulty in assembling such data is the main obstacle to cohort analysis.

# Period analysis
Comparing the characteristics of populations at one or more points in time is the
best-known means to studying differences and changes.
