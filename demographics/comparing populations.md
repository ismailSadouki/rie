# 4.2 Direct standardization
T here are two approaches to standardization: ' direct' and ' indirect' .
Direct standardization employs a 'standard' age structure (or other aspect of popula tion composition), while indirect standardization employs a standard set of age-specific rates - calculated for each age group:

To calculate a sta ndardized crude rate, the steps are:
1. Select a standard population, whose age distribution will be the sta ndard for
comparison. The standard population is normally the population of foremost
interest in an investiga tion.

#### Interpreting standardized rates
The main benefit of direct standardization is that it facilitates comparisons by re-
moving the confounding effects on rates of age structure variations, or other dif-
ferences in population composition.
In interpreting and presenting findings, another question arising concerns
whether the standardized rates should be used instead of the original crude rates.
Standardized rates provide comparisons, but do not substitute for the original
rates.They are constructs that indicate the effects of compositional influences.
They va ry according to the standard adopted.
