# 2.5 Growth and replacement
Studies often need to go beyond appropriate measures of growth or
decline to include reference to the components of population changes

A related concept is population turnover, which denotes the sum of all losses and
gains:

Thus, population turnover is equal to losses (the numbers to be replaced) plus
gross growth:

Population turnover captures the total magnitude of changes in membership that
a population experiences


Overall, an adequate understanding of population dynamics and their implica-
tions calls for more than attention to the net growth or net decline in numbers. To
obtain a more complete understanding of population change, informative con-
cepts are turnover, replacement, gross growth and net growth.


Growth and decline are essential topics in many national and sub-national popu-
lation studies; they often serve as a starting point in identifying demographic
trends and their implications for planning and policy making.
