T he demographic balancing eq ua tion refers to changes in tota l numbers, rather
tha n changes in growth rates.

# 1.6 Basic measures of change
## Crude birth and death rates

- The rates are 'crude' because they make no reference to sma ller groups that
might better represent the population likely to experience the event. In more de-
veloped countries, for exa mple, the major.icy of deaths are in the o lder ages.
- Crude rates a re calculated fo r calendar yea rs. If the birth or death data do not refer to a calendar year the average number of events per year is used instead (Barclay 1966: 35-36). Thus the numerator refers either to the number of events in a calendar year - such as births or deaths - or to the average number per year. Similarly, the denominator refers either to the mid-year population, or to the average popula tion for the period.
## Rates of natural increase and net migration

Net migration may be obtained from the balancing equation as a residual left after subtracting natural increase from the tota l population growth.
