### Randomized Controlled Experiment
A **Randomized Controlled Experiment (RCT)** is a study design used to establish **causal relationships** by randomly assigning subjects into **treatment** and **control** groups.

### Forecasting
statisticians and econometricians call prediction, which is using information on some variables to make a statement about the value of another variable. A forecast is a prediction about the value of a variable in the future


# Data: Sources and Types
## Sources

### observational data

## Types

Data on different entities—workers, consumers, firms, governmental units, and so forth—for a single time period are called cross-sectional data.
### Time series data
Time series data are data for a single entity (person, firm, country) collected at multiple time periods.

### Panel data
