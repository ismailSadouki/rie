 A forward proxy, or gateway provides proxy services to a client or a group of clients, they store and forward internet services (like the DNS) to reduce and control the bandwidth used by the group, can also be anonymous and allow users to hide their IP address using other Internet service (.e.g tor routers internet traffic through multiple proxies for anonymity), all attempts to send requests by the client will instead be sent to the forward proxy, the client has no direct access to the internet, it can only reach what the forward proxy allows it to access, which means the forward proxy access the internet in place of client.
 A forward proxy server first check to make sure a request is valid, if a request is not valid. or not allowed (blocked by the proxy), it will reject the request resulting in the client receiving an error or a redirect. if a request is valid, a forward proxy may check if the requested information is cached.
