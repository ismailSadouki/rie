## Part 4: Challenges Facing Information Systems

### 1. Technical Challenges

#### • Integration Issues Between Old and New Systems

Many companies still use old software systems—sometimes more than 10 or 20 years old. These are called "legacy systems." They were built in a different time, with different technology, so they often don’t work well with today’s modern tools.

For example, imagine a company wants to use a new customer management system (CRM) to keep track of clients and improve communication. But their old system doesn’t “talk” well with the new one. As a result, data may not move correctly, and employees might end up doing double work—entering the same data in two different places. This wastes time and causes confusion.

For example in my previes work as a profissional IT, I had a problem were The company had multiple computers that needed to access the same database to save common data. However, these computers were not connected to each other so if i want to change something or for example add a user to the database i had to visit each computer individually to update the database, which was really time-consuming. 
also When something went wrong, I needed to address the issue on each computer separately, making problem-solving more complex.

Fixing these problems often needs special solutions, and sometimes, companies even have to rebuild parts of their systems from scratch. That takes time, money, and planning.
#### • Constant Need to Upgrade Infrastructure to Meet Evolving Demands

As businesses grow and technology improves, there's a constant need to update the systems they use—both hardware (like servers and computers) and software (like operating systems and apps). If a company ignores updates, it starts to face serious problems: slower system speed, more technical errors, and sometimes even complete failure of tools that employees need to do their jobs.

But one of the biggest dangers of using outdated systems is **security**.

### 2. Security Challenges

#### • Cybersecurity Threats Like Hacking and Data Breaches

in Every day, companies face cyber threats. 

Hackers dont sleep.and they are always finding new ways to break into systems. When software companies find these weaknesses, they usually fix them by releasing updates. But if a company doesn't install these updates, its systems stay weak—like an old house with broken locks. Hackers can easily break in, steal private data, or even shut down important services. These attacks can cost the company a lot of money and damage its reputation.

For example, in 2017, many businesses around the world were hit by a cyberattack called “WannaCry.” It affected computers that didn’t have the latest Windows update installed. Hospitals, banks, and government offices were all victims—just because they hadn’t updated their systems. acually that the cost of using widows,i'm sure that Linux users just kept sipping coffee, wondering what a “WannaCry” even was.hhhh unless they are responsible for the cyberattack

So, upgrading isn’t just about staying fast and modern—it’s also about staying safe.

### • Importance of Encryption and Security Policies to Protect Information

In today's digital age, safeguarding sensitive information is paramount. **Encryption** plays a crucial role by converting readable data into a coded format, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access it. This means that even if cybercriminals intercept the data, they cannot understand or misuse it without the proper decryption key. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption?utm_source=chatgpt.com)​

Alongside encryption, implementing robust **security policies** is essential. These policies guide employees on best practices, such as:​

- Using strong, unique passwords.
    
- Regularly updating software and systems.
    
    

Think of encryption as locking your data in a secure safe, and security policies as the rules ensuring that only trusted individuals have the key. Together, they form a strong defense against unauthorized access and data breaches.​

as an example i remember a funny problem faced me On my first day  as an IT, I observed a concerning practice where in that day my supervisor took me to see how the work is done in the indusrie so i was just like a visitor and from my first day i noteced that he was manually entering passwords into the database and encrypting them by himself using sha1, so as u can see from a secutiry point of view i wasent even supposed to know that the encryption type is sha1. and u never enter the password directly from the database bcz This approach not only risked human error but also exposed the system to potential security breaches. so Proper encryption should be automated and handled by the system to ensure consistency and security.

### 3. Human and Organizational Challenges

#### • Employee Resistance to New Systems

Even when a company brings in a great new system, employees might resist using it. This happens a lot. People get used to doing things a certain way. They may feel afraid of change or think the new system will make their work harder.

For example, if a company switches from paper-based processes to digital ones, older employees might struggle. They may not be comfortable with computers or worry about losing their jobs.

This resistance can slow down progress and create conflict inside the company.

#### • Need for Effective Training

That’s why good training is so important. When employees understand how to use the new system—and see how it helps—they become more open to change.

Training doesn't have to be complicated. It can be short workshops, one-on-one sessions, or even simple video tutorials. The key is to make people feel confident, not confused.

When people feel supported, the change goes much smoother.

### 4. Regulatory Compliance

#### • Following Data Protection Rules Like GDPR and ISO 27001

In many countries, there are strict laws about how companies must protect personal information. For example, in Europe, there’s the GDPR. It says companies must ask permission to collect data and explain how it will be used. If they break the rules, they can be fined millions.

There are also international standards like ISO 27001. These provide a set of rules for managing information securely.

For companies, following these rules isn’t optional. It’s a must. Not following them can lead to legal trouble, loss of customers, and serious damage to the company’s image.
