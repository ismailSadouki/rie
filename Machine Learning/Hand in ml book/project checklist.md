exploring data preparation options, trying out
multiple models, shortlisting the best ones and fine-tuning their hyperparameters
using GridSearchCV, and automating as much as possible, as you did in the previous

- check feature importance

- when you use gridsearchCV, if u see in ur best params are in the max, try to add more and incraese them

- try scaling data
- try ExtraTreesClassifier in place of RandomForestClassifier
- Try Boosting like AdaBoost or Gradient Boosting and XGboost

- Use Early Stopping with OOB Score
