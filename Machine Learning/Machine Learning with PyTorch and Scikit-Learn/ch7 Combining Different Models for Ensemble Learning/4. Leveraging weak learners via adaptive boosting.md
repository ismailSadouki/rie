In boosting, the ensemble consists of very simple base classifiers, also often referred to as **weak learners**, which often only have a slight performance advantage over random guessing.

The key concept behind boosting is to focus on training examples that are hard to classify, that is, to let the weak learners subsequently learn from misclassified training examples to improve the performance of the ensemble.
