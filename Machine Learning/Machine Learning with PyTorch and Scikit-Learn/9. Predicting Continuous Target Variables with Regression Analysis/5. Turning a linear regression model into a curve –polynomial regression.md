One way to account for the violation of linearity assumption is to use a polynomial regression model by adding polynomial terms:

Although we can use polynomial regression to model a nonlinear relationship, it is still considered a multiple linear regression model because of the linear regression coefficients, w. In the following subsections, we will see how we can add such polynomial terms to an existing dataset conveniently and fit a polynomial regression model.
