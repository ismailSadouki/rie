# Loading the Ames Housing dataset into a DataFrame
The Ames Housing dataset consists of 2,930 examples and 80 features. For simplicity, we will only work with a subset of the features.
The features we will be working with, including the target variable, are as follows:
• Overall Qual: Rating for the overall material and finish of the house on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent)
• Overall Cond: Rating for the overall condition of the house on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent)
• Gr Liv Area: Above grade (ground) living area in square feet
•Central Air: Central air conditioning (N=no, Y=yes)
•Total Bsmt SF: Total square feet of the basement area
•SalePrice: Sale price in U.S. dollars ($)

we will regard the sale price (SalePrice) as our target variable
```
import pandas as pd

columns = ['Overall Qual', 'Overall Cond', 'Gr Liv Area','Central Air', 'Total Bsmt SF', 'SalePrice']
df = pd.read_csv('http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/AmesHousing.txt',sep='\t',usecols=columns)
df.head()
```
The following code will convert the string 'Y' to the integer 1, and the string 'N' to the integer 0:
```
df['Central Air'] = df['Central Air'].map({'N':0, 'Y':1})
```
```
df = df.dropna(axis=0)
```

## Visualizing the important characteristics of a dataset
To plot the scatterplot matrix, we will use the scatterplotmatrix function from the mlxtend library

we can now quickly see how the data is distributed and whether it con-
tains outliers. For example, we can see (fifth column from the left of the bottom row) that there is a somewhat linear relationship between the size of the living area above ground (Gr Liv Area) and the sale price (SalePrice).

Furthermore, we can see in the histogram—the lower-right subplot in the scatterplot matrix—that the SalePrice variable seems to be skewed by several outliers.

# Looking at relationships using a correlation matrix

In the following code example, we will use NumPy’s corrcoef function on the five feature columns that we previously visualized in the scatterplot matrix, and we will use mlxtend’s heatmap function to plot the correlation matrix array as a heat map:
```
import numpy as np
from mlxtend.plotting import heatmap

cm = np.corrcoef(df.values.T)
hm = heatmap(cm, row_names=df.columns, column_names=df.columns)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

we are interested in those features that have a high correlation with
our target variable, SalePrice. Looking at the previous correlation matrix, we can see that SalePrice shows the largest correlation with the Gr Liv Area variable (0.71), which seems to be a good choice for an exploratory variable to introduce the concepts of a simple linear regression model in the following section.
