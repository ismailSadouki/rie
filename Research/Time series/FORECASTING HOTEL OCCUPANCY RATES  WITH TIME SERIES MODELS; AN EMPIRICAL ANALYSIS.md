# Abstract
Thisstudy examinesempiricallythe useof twotimeseries models, BoxJenkins and exponentialsmoothing,for forecastinghoteloccupancyrates. Themodels are fittedand tested using actualmonthly occupancyrates fora major csnter-cityhotel. Both models show a high level of predictive accuracy. Since these models are relatively easy to implement, they should be very useful in actual hotel operations andother applicationssuch asyield management. Key Words: Forecasting,hotel occupancy, time,series models, Box-Jenkins, exponential smoothing, predictive accuracy.
