# Abstract
Data mining has become an essential tool during the last decade to analyze large sets of data. The variety of techniques it includes and the successful results obtained in many application fields, make this family of approaches powerful and widely used. In particular, this work explores the application of these techniques to time series forecasting. Although classical statistical-based methods provides reasonably good results, the result of the application of data mining outperforms those of classical ones. Hence, this work faces two main challenges: (i) to provide a compact mathematical formulation of the mainly used techniques; (ii) to review the latest works of time series forecasting and, as case study, those related to electricity price and demand markets.


# 3. Accuracy Measures
## 3.1. Scale-Dependent Measures
When comparing forecast methods on a single data set, the MAE is popular as it is easy to understand and compute. While MAE do not penalize extreme forecast errors, MSE and RMSE emphasize the fact that the total forecast error is in fact much affected by large individual errors, i.e., large errors are much expensive than small errors. Often, the RMSE is preferred to the MSE as it is on the same scale as the data. However, MSE and RMSE are more sensitive to outliers than MAE or MDAE.

As for Section 5, it is a compendium of the non-linear forecasting techniques currently in use in the data mining domain. In particular, these methods are divided into global (neural networks, support vector machines, genetic programming) and local (nearest neighbors). In Section 6, rule-based forecasting methods are analyzed, providing a brief explanation of what a decision rule is, and revisiting the latest and most relevant works in this domain. The use of wavelets, as relevant method for hybridization, is detailed in Section 7 as well as discussing the most relevant improvements achieved by means of these techniques. A compilation of several works that cannot be classified in none of the aforementioned groups is described in Section 8. Thus, forecasting approaches based on Markov processes, on Grey models, on Pattern-Sequence similarity or on manifold dimensionality reduction, are there detailed. Due to the large amount of ensemble models that are being used nowadays, Section 9 is devoted to cover these methods. Finally, the conclusions drawn from the exploration of all existing techniques are summarized in Section 10.
