If you are building involved machine learning systems, we highly recommend reading the paper “Machine Learning: The High Interest Credit Card of Technical Debt”, published by researchers in Google’s machine learning team. The paper highlights the trade-off in creating and maintaining machine learning software in production at a large scale. While the issue of technical debt is particularly pressing in large-scale and long-term projects, the lessons learned can help us build better software even for short-lived and smaller systems.


Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization by John Myles White (O’Reilly).
Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective by Stephen Marsland (Chapman and Hall/CRC).

Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop
(Springer), a book that emphasizes a probabilistic framework, and Machine Learning:A Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy (MIT Press)

A great introduction to ranking is provided in Manning, Raghavan,
and Schütze’s book Introduction to Information Retrieval.
