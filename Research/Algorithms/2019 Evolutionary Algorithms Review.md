## Self-Replicating Neural Networks
**Self-Replicating Neural Networks** is an emerging concept where artificial neural networks (ANNs) can autonomously reconfigure, generate their own weights, and even regenerate. The main ideas include:

1. **Self-Configuration:** Networks can produce and adjust their own weights instead of being manually configured, enabling dynamic adaptation.
2. **Regeneration:** Networks can be trained by predicting their own parameters, creating a self-improvement loop without external intervention.
3. **Autonomy and Adaptability:** These networks learn from their own outputs, allowing them to adapt to changing environments or tasks over time.

### Challenges:

- **Stability and Control:** Ensuring the network evolves in a stable and controlled manner is difficult.
- **Complexity of Regeneration:** Teaching a network to predict and adjust its own parameters is computationally intensive and complex.
- **Computational Resources:** The process of self-replication and regeneration requires significant computational power.

### Potential:

- **Autonomous Systems:** Can enable AI that evolves and adapts autonomously.
- **Self-Improving AI:** Networks can refine and improve their performance over time.
- **Applications:** Useful for dynamic environments, such as robotics and artificial life.

Self-replicating neural networks are still in early research stages but have great potential for future AI systems.



## **Symbolic and Polynomial Regression**
Symbolic and polynomial regression are techniques used to find mathematical equations that best describe a given dataset. The goal is to discover an explicit formula that fits the observed data, which is valuable in many industries, including automotive, engineering, and finance.;


## Automated machine learning  
EAs are starting to be used in the new subject of Automated Machine Learning (or more commonly known as AutoML) [47,53]. AutoML is the automation of machine learning to real problem-domains. The goal is to avoid the labor intensive configuration required to setup a Deep Neural Network (DNN). This method also potentially bypasses the requirement for domain experts

# **TPOT**
**TPOT** stands for **T**ree-based **P**ipeline **O**ptimization **T**ool. Consider TPOT your **Data Science Assistant**. TPOT is a Python Automated Machine Learning tool that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.

## Forecasting financial markets
GA are used by institutional quantitative traders and other areas of the financial world [36]. Traders use software packages to set parameters that are optimized using both historical data and a GA. Depending upon the problem, the optimization can vary from which parameters are being used and the associated values to only optimizing the values. Trading comes with some risk but identifying the right parameters that relate to major market turns can be critica
