## RANDOMNESS

### computationally random Vs  statistically random
 computationally random refers to methods where all 
possible solutions are generated through an algorithmic process, while 
statistically random involves generating random solutions using 
statistical techniques. Both approaches can be used for exploration 
and optimization but have different characteristics in terms of 
efficiency and randomness.


### Chaotic Number Generator VS Pseudo-Random Number Generator
PRNGs generate seemingly random numbers using mathematical 
algorithms but can be analyzed over time, while Chaotic Number 
Generators use nonlinear dynamical systems that exhibit complex and 
unpredictable behavior. While both are used for generating random 
numbers in various applications, Chaotic Number Generators offer a 
more realistic representation of true randomness.


###  Quasi-Random Sequences generate  VS  Uniform Experimental Designs
 Quasi-Random Sequences generate a seemingly random 
sequence using deterministic algorithms but may not be truly random, 
while Uniform Experimental Designs involve allocating samples 
uniformly to different treatments in an experimental design, 
ensuring that there is no bias towards specific conditions. Both 
concepts are used in various applications such as optimization or 
statistical inference.


## COMPOSITIONALITY

### Non-compositional VS compositional
 non-compositional  refers to systems that are complex due to their interactions with other parts rather than being composed of simpler building blocks, while compositional refers to systems that can be decomposed into standalone functional units for analysis and manipulation. Both concepts play a role in understanding the nature of complexity in various domains, such as engineering, biology, or social sciences.



# Conclusion
This study provided a comprehensive and systematic survey of the existing population initialization techniques for EAs. Three categories were introduced to stamp existing techniques in terms of some exclusive characteristics, i.e., randomness, compositionality and generality. This categorization as well as the representative techniques described in each (sub-)category will benefit EA researchers for choosing from proper state-ofthe-art population initialization techniques for their research. The volume of the surveyed techniques revealed that population initialization has become an active research topic in the EA domain. However, many open questions still remain to be resolved. Some of these questions were discussed while more future investigations were advocated.
