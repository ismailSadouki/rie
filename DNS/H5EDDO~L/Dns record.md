There are many DNS record types, Common DNS records are the following:
- A: is the default, which holds the IPv4 address of a domain.
- AAAA: same as the A record but it's for IPv6 addresses.
-  PTR:  the opposite of what A record does, you give an IP address, and it returns the hostname.
- NS: used to figure out what is the name services are for particular zone. multiple NS records are used to direct queries to them.
- TXT: this enable administrators to enter text into DNS.
- CNAME: Canonical name records, they are aliases for other tree elements (can be in the same zone or in another)
-  mx: used to define the mail exchanges that are used for the domain.
