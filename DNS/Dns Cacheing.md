The goal of DNS caching is to reduce the time it takes to get an answer to a DNS query.
suppose the ISP name server is your recursive resolver and it's serving thousandth customers and all of them want to visit google website, the DNS resolution is a waste of time if it will happen when every person try to visit google website , especially given that google not changing their ip every hour, so the first one in the morning gets up and goes to google.com is gonna wait a few more seconds for the DNS resolution to find the google ip address but then it will put it in the cache of the ISP server with TTL (TIME TO LIVE, the length of time the record is held) , so when the next person want to visit google website, the ISP name server will return directly the IP address of google.com form it's cache without starting again a DNS resolution.
